# CountriesApp
A simple React App created to show my skills.
Here are some important notes as info:

- Axios + React query is used for fetching API data
- React Context is used for accessing data globally without prop drilling/extra unnecessary API calls
- react-router-dom was used for navigation. You can navigate to a continental view clicking on its corresponding bar in the global view, or navigate to the global view by clicking on the AppBar globe logo
- Chart JS was the chosen library for the bar charts
- The App is responsive! It looks awesome both in wide and small screens 😃
- You can quickly see how the App looks in visualExample.gif 👁️
